# Price vs. Value

Link: [The Important Differences Between Price And Value](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2018/01/04/the-important-differences-between-price-and-value/)

This article is posted a long time ago but now I have the occasion to read it and think for a bit.

To understand the difference between price and value, we can quote a famous saying of Warren Buffett:

> Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.

According to the article, **price is arbitrary and value is fundamental**. In particular, the price is what set by the seller for their own reasons. For example, the stock's price is determined by various factors in the market and by humans, but these factors rarely significantly affect the intrinsic value of the stock. One truth believed by many investors is that **a stock's price almost always levels back out with its value**. And note that, this is crucial for investors such as Warren Buffet to make billions.

Let's take a simple real-life example. If you go to a luxurious hotel and buy a bottle of wine for 100 pounds, which is five-fold the price of the same bottle at a grocery store, have you correctly priced it at 20 pounds? In fact, what usually happens is that we're not just paying for the wine, but also for the atmosphere in the hotel, the service, the location, serving skills of the waiter, the good relationships, privacy and freedom, style and fashion, tradition, food, reliability, the surrounding scenery, other customers, the potentially beneficial talks, and so on. The bottle of wine itself is virtually irrelevant and that's the problem. We think we've priced something correctly but the values it brings exceed what we pay.

So how can we leverage the differences between price and value in investment?
When we want to invest in a company, evaluate it using a **set of standards that look beyond's the company's current price tag**. These standards are the four Ms:
- **Meaning**: Make sure the company you invest in has meaning to you. If it does, you'll understand it better, be more likely to research it and be more passionate about investing in it.
- **Moat**: This means that there is something inherent about the company that makes it difficult for competitors to step in and carve away part of their market share. For example, Coca-Cola's moat is their brand. Anyone can make a soft drink, but there's only one Coca-Cola.
- **Management**: Companies live and die by the people managing them, and if you are going to invest in a company, you need to make sure their management is talented and trustworthy.
- **Margin of Safety**: This is the price at which you can buy shares, being almost sure that you won't lose money and confident that you will make a good return. There are a variety of formulas and calculators you can use to calculate a company's margin of safety. If, though, the price of the company is at or lower than the number you come up with, they are underpriced and are a great investment opportunity.

Find a company that you believe in, that has solid fundamentals -- then wait until their price falls below their value. If you do this, you can buy companies on sale, sell them for their true value and make a lot of money in the process.
